## Day-to-Day

### Group of three

The Driver-Navigator roles will require one person directly coding and two others observing, guiding, and researching solutions. Driver role will rotate between members, with the goal being rough balance of time and practice in desired growth areas.

### Conflict Resolution

Set clear goals and divisions of tasks: 
Communicate first: attempt to resolve directly as a full group, then ask for Ryan’s involvement.
Approach each other with kindness, grace, and empathy. This is first and foremost a learning environment-- this project should be an opportunity for maximum growth, not best possible results.
